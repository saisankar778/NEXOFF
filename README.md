### 3. Install Python Dependencies
From the `offline/` directory:
```bash
cd offline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare Local Models (Offline Mode)
- Download the required Hugging Face model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and place it in `local_models/` as described in the code comments.
- Ensure the path in your Python code matches the local model directory.
- Set the environment variable for offline transformers:
  - On Windows (CMD):
    ```cmd
    set TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1
    ```
  - On PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    $env:TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE="1"

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Model not found / No internet:**
  - Ensure the model is downloaded and the path is correct in your code.
  - Set `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` to prevent internet access attempts.
- **Path issues (Windows):**
  - If your path has spaces or parentheses, use quotes or escape them as needed.
- **Voice not working:**
  - Check your microphone and speaker permissions.
- **PDF chat errors:**
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed and the PDF is not corrupted.
